version 0.010; 2013-09-21

  * bugfix: require bugfixed version of DateTime::TimeZone::SystemV to
    handle ->offset_for_local_datetime with perpetual-DST ruleset that
    can arise with a version-3 tzfile

version 0.009; 2013-09-20

  * support version 3 of the tzfile format

version 0.008; 2013-07-14

  * bugfix: require bugfixed version of DateTime::TimeZone::SystemV to
    handle POSIX-TZ field showing transitions occurring at 24:00

  * in META.{yml,json}, point to public git repository

version 0.007; 2012-03-10

  * bugfix: recognise zone disuse indicator if it comes in the form of
    the POSIX-TZ extension rule

  * distinguish between zone disuse and missing data

  * eliminate use of Date::JD, because it's too heavy to justify the
    minimal convenience gained from it

  * eliminate use of constant.pm, for stylistic consistency

  * test more error cases

  * test behaviour around leap seconds

  * factor out date/time presentation code used for error messages

  * for CRLF test, use a smaller tzfile that tickles the same potential
    bug

  * give test tzfiles appropriately capitalised names

  * convert .cvsignore to .gitignore

version 0.006; 2011-09-27

  * include the time and zone name in error messages about non-existent
    local time and unrepresented time

  * check argument types in constructor

  * make test suite work even if DateTime is not available

version 0.005; 2011-04-05

  * bugfix: read tzfiles in binary mode

  * include META.json in distribution

  * add MYMETA.json to .cvsignore

version 0.004; 2010-08-31

  * for the Olson "Factory" timezone, which has a pseudo-abbreviation
    containing spaces, don't process the TZ value that it contains,
    because it's invalid and DateTime::TimeZone::SystemV objects to it

  * tighten the criteria for recognising the special observance that
    indicates that local time is not defined (abbreviation "zzz" was
    previously the sole criterion, now also require zero offset and
    not DST)

  * allow the ->is_olson and ->category values to be specified to the
    constructor, instead of having fixed values

  * when a local time is non-existent due to an undefined observance,
    give an error message that says so, rather than conflating it with
    local time being non-existent due to an offset change

  * add DateTime::TimeZone::Olson, Time::OlsonTZ::Data, and
    Time::OlsonTZ::Download to the "see also" list

  * test the error message that is given when a local time does not
    exist due to an offset change

version 0.003; 2010-07-30

  * in documentation, correct one use of "filename" to "filehandle"

  * in documentation, use the term "truth value" instead of the less
    precise "boolean"

  * abandon use of the "fields" module

  * check for required Perl version at runtime

  * use full stricture in test suite

  * in Build.PL, explicitly declare configure-time requirements

  * remove bogus "exit 0" from Build.PL

  * add MYMETA.yml to .cvsignore

version 0.002; 2009-03-22

  * with a version-1 tzfile, treat the last observance as continuing
    indefinitely, rather than as having no rule for the future

  * test POD syntax and coverage, and rename some internal functions to
    satisfy the coverage test

  * drop prototypes from method subs (where the prototypes have no effect)

  * in tests, avoid unreliable "\d" regexp element

  * typo fix in documentation

  * really complete dependency list (was missing "integer", and
    build_requires was missing "IO::File")

  * include "distribution_type" entry in META.yml to satisfy CPANTS

  * in documentation, separate "license" section from "copyright" section

  * use full stricture in Build.PL

  * remove from .cvsignore items that don't occur with Module::Build

version 0.001; 2007-09-12

  * bugfix: override any ambient $SIG{__DIE__} handler when using eval { }

  * bugfix: require bugfixed version of DateTime::TimeZone::SystemV
    (for $SIG{__DIE__} handling)

  * new key/value constructor parameter style

  * constructor option to set timezone name independently from filename

  * constructor option to supply an open filehandle

  * use "fields" module to structure object

  * build with Module::Build instead of ExtUtils::MakeMaker

  * complete dependency list

  * include signature in distribution

version 0.000; 2007-02-10

  * initial released version
